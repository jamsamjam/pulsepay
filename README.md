## Fraud Scoring

Four signals combine for a score 0–100:

| Signal | Max Points | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH_VELOCITY | 30 | >10 transactions in 10 minutes |
| ELEVATED_VELOCITY | 15 | >5 transactions in 10 minutes |
| AMOUNT_ANOMALY_EXTREME | 55 | >5× deviation from card's average |
| AMOUNT_ANOMALY | 25 | >2× deviation from card's average |
| GEO_IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL | 30 | Different country within 60 minutes |
| ODD_HOURS | 15 | 2am–5am UTC |

> [!Note]
> The signal weights and thresholds here are demo-tuned, not data-calibrated. In production, these would be derived from labelled historical transactions by sweeping thresholds against a ROC curve and choosing an operating point based on acceptable false-positive rate (legitimate transactions blocked) vs. false-negative rate (fraud let through).


## Circuit Breaker

Per-provider state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CLOSED

    CLOSED --> OPEN: 3 consecutive failures
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN: after 30s timeout
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED: probe success
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN: probe failure
```

**Demo:** Click "Inject Failure" on adyen in the dashboard → watch traffic automatically reroute to braintree within 1 failed payment. Click "Recover" to restore adyen.

## Idempotency

Every payment requires an `idempotencyKey`. Sending the same key twice returns the original result without double charge.

<details>
<summary>API Example</summary>

```bash
# Both calls return the same transactionId
curl -X POST .../payments -d '{"idempotencyKey":"key-001", ...}'
curl -X POST .../payments -d '{"idempotencyKey":"key-001", ...}'  # ← same response
```
</details>

## Load Test Results

Tested on a single Apple M2 Pro (all services in Docker on one machine).

| Test | VUs | Duration | Requests | TPS | P50 | P95 | Error Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | 50 | 2 min | 3,326 | **28 TPS** | 1.01 s | 6.05 s | 2.0% [1] | Single machine, steady state |
| Spike | 0→500 | 2 min | 16,550 | **138 TPS** | 624 ms | 15 s | 94.0% [2] | Saturates above ~50 VUs; timeouts dominate at peak |
| Failure injection | 50 | 2 min | 4,920 | **40 TPS** | 705 ms | 4.1 s | 31.5% [3] | Stripe injected at t≈8s, circuit breaker reroutes |

[1] Fraud block rate was 38% in the baseline run — the load test's random amounts and country codes accumulate history and trigger amount-deviation signals over time. This is expected; the demo uses controlled card inputs where score is 0 on clean cards.  
[2] Spike error rate reflects connection timeouts under 500-VU burst. The routing algorithm uses weighted-random selection with a per-transaction fallback loop; saturation point is lower than a simple single-best-provider approach but resilience under partial failure is higher.  
[3] Failure injection errors include transactions that hit Stripe in the 3-failure window before the circuit breaker tripped, plus fraud-block rate. After the breaker opened, traffic successfully rerouted to Adyen/Braintree.

> [!Note]
> **Bottleneck analysis**: Each SAGA transaction holds a DB connection while making 3 synchronous HTTP calls (fraud engine → ledger → provider, each 100–400ms). On one machine with simulated provider latency, this limits throughput to ~28 TPS. In production with:
> - Horizontal orchestrator scaling (3× replicas) → ~84 TPS
> - Async fraud scoring (fire-and-forget) → ~60 TPS per replica
> - Real providers (sub-10ms vs 80–400ms mock) → **~400+ TPS**

- [ADR-003: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Fraud Scoring](./docs/adr-003-async-fraud-scoring.md)

## Scaling Configuration

Key tuning parameters (via environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FRAUD_BLOCK_THRESHOLD` | 80 | Score above which transactions are blocked |
| `FRAUD_FLAG_THRESHOLD` | 50 | Score above which transactions are flagged |
| `PROVIDER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | 3 | Consecutive failures to trip circuit |
| `PROVIDER_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 30 | Seconds before HALF_OPEN probe |
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_HIKARI_MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE` | 50 | DB connection pool per orchestrator instance |

## Future Works

**Fraud threshold calibration**: In a real system the thresholds and signal weights would be derived from labelled transaction history using precision/recall analysis, trading off false positive rate (legitimate transactions blocked) against false negative rate (fraud let through). This can be further extended to a ML-based fraud scoring model.

**Async fraud scoring**: fraud engine is called synchronously in the SAGA, blocking the orchestrator thread for 100–400ms per transaction. Moving to fire-and-forget with a short timeout and a fallback allow-with-flag policy would significantly increase throughput.

**Geo signal improvement**: current geo anomaly is a binary country mismatch within 60 minutes. A real implementation would use haversine distance between coordinates and a velocity threshold (km/h) to distinguish genuine impossible travel from a US→CA hop.

**Horizontal scaling**: the orchestrator is a single instance sharing a Postgres connection pool. Adding replicas requires distributed idempotency key locking (currently in-memory) to prevent duplicate processing under concurrent retries.
